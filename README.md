# Portfolio

These are my personal projects.

# Packages

## [FRP tools](./packages/frptools/README.md)

Observable and computed value stores designed to work together for storing real state and derived state.

## [Portal](./packages/portal/README.md)

A utility to expose an asynchronous API between a web worker and its parent.

## [Router](./packages/router/README.md)

A slim and unopinionated router.

## [Trimkit](./packages/trimkit/README.md)

Javascript API abstractions to enhance minification by substituting variables.  It's really quite silly.
