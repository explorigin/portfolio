# Portfolio

These are my personal projects.

# Packages

## [FRP tools](./packages/frptools/README.md)

Observable property and computed value stores designed to work together for storing real and derived state.

## [Gallery](./packages/gallery/README.md)

A browser-based app for viewing photos. (WIP)

## [Portal](./packages/portal/README.md)

A utility to expose an asynchronous API between a web worker and its parent.

## [Router](./packages/router/README.md)

A slim and unopinionated hash router.

## [Trimkit](./packages/trimkit/README.md)

Javascript API abstractions to enhance minification by substituting variables.  It's really quite silly.

# Dependencies

These are `npm --global` dependencies:

- [Lerna 2.0.0](https://lernajs.io/)
- [Rollup 0.53.3](https://rollupjs.org/)

# Installation

1. Install global dependencies
2. `git clone` the repository
3. `lerna bootstrap`

Now each package is built and ready for use.  Stay tuned for working examples.
