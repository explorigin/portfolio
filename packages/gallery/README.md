# Gallery

This photo gallery originally stemmed from my personal desire to have and host my own memories for myself and to share with friends and family. Along the way it became a learning tool as well.

## Development Philosophy

Currently this is a browser-only application.  I have an idealistic attraction to the [unhosted](https://unhosted.org/) movement and have dreams of this gallery becoming a popular photo gallery for anyone who wishes to escape the social media silos.

## Technology

This would not be possible without the giants who have laid the foundation:

 - [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org/)
 - [DOMVM](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/)
 - [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/)

There are many more dependencies. You can find them in the [package.json](./package.json) file.

## Plan

In the future, I plan to add:

 - CORS-based storage (to s3 or Google Cloud)
 - Sandstorm support
 - client-side encryption
 - albums
 - tags
 - sharable links
 - video support
